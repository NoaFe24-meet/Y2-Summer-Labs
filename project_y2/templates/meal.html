            <h2>Chilli Beef Wraps with Guacamole</h2>
            <p class="ingredients"><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                300g brown rice<br>
                4-6 wholemeal tortilla wraps, to serve<br>
                <strong>For the chilli:</strong><br>
                1 tsp olive oil<br>
                400g-500g beef mince<br>
                1 large onion, finely chopped<br>
                2 garlic cloves, crushed<br>
                2 tsp chipotle paste<br>
                1 tbsp Cajun or fajita seasoning<br>
                1 tbsp brown sugar<br>
                1 tbsp cider vinegar<br>
                400g can black beans, drained but not rinsed<br>
                400g can chopped tomato<br>
                <strong>For the guacamole:</strong><br>
                1 tomato, chopped<br>
                1 red onion, finely chopped<br>
                Â½ small pack coriander, chopped<br>
                1 lime, juiced<br>
                2 avocados, stoned and peeled<br>
                <strong>To serve:</strong><br>
                natural yogurt, lime halves to squeeze over and grated cheddar (optional)
            </p>

            <div class="method">
                <h3>Method:</h3>

                    <li>
                        First make the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, crumble in the mince and fry for 15-20 mins. At first, it will release some liquid, but once that has bubbled away, the mince will sizzle in its own fat and start to brown and crisp. At this point, break it up using a wooden spoon so it browns and caramelises all over, then stir in the onion and cook for another 10 mins until the onion has softened. Add the garlic, chipotle paste, spice mix, sugar, and vinegar, and cook for 1 min. Tip in the beans and tomatoes, give everything a stir and simmer, uncovered, for 20 mins until thickened. Will keep chilled for two days or frozen for a month. Defrost thoroughly and reheat until piping hot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, put the rice in a medium saucepan with 600ml cold water and a pinch of salt, if you like. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down low, cover and gently simmer for about 20 mins until all the water has been absorbed. Turn off the heat and leave for another 10 mins undisturbed. Stir the rice and leave to stand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the guacamole, mix the tomatoes with the onion, coriander, lime juice and some seasoning, then mash to make a chunky guacamole.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To serve, warm the tortillas, roughly spread over some of the guacamole, add a generous layer of rice, then the chilli, natural yogurt, lime juice and grated cheddar, if you like. Wrap everything up tight and halve through the middle and serve.

                        Bring a pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the broccoli and boil for 1 min 30 secs, or until tender. Drain and set aside. Cook the spaghetti following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a ladleful of cooking water.

                        Add the tomatoes to the pan and fry over a medium heat for 5 mins, or until beginning to soften and turn juicy. Stir through the prawns and cook for 2 mins, or until turning pink. Add the harissa and lemon zest, stirring to coat.

                    <li>
                        Toss the cooked spaghetti and pasta water through the prawns and harissa. Stir through the broccoli, season to taste and serve.
